    <h3>Mental Disorders Across the World</h3>
    <h4>Firo Kaveh</h4>
    <p>
      Each year millions of people all over the world battle with some sort of
      mental health issues. However, people still have to face the stigma around
      mental health problems and often suffer in silence without seeking
      treatment for their condition. That is why mental health awareness is a
      must to improve understanding of different conditions and disorders and
      provide better access to healthcare and accommodations for those who need
      it. The goal of this project is to throw some light on major mental
      disorders across the world.
